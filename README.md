Dependencies
This app relies on the following dependencies:

React
Redux
react-redux
Code
The HomePage component is where most of the app logic is located. It imports the useSelector and useDispatch hooks from react-redux, as well as the filterByPrice and filterByType actions from the app's reducer.

The component includes a div for the app header, as well as two buttons that allow users to filter the list of houses by price or type. When a user clicks one of these buttons, the corresponding action is dispatched to the Redux store.

The component also includes a div that displays the list of houses. This list is generated by mapping over the displayList array, which is populated by the Redux store's DisplayList state.

The Card component is imported from the components directory and is used to display each individual house listing.
